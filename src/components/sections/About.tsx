        <h2>About Us:</h2>
        <p>
          Carte Blanche is a dynamic and inclusive club at Brown University
          dedicated to advancing the principles of decolonization. We recognize
          the need to critically examine the colonial legacies that continue to
          shape our world and seek to foster an environment where open dialogue
          and transformative action can thrive. Our club&apos;s name,
          &quot;Carte Blanche,&quot; reflects our commitment to providing an
          open canvas where students from diverse backgrounds can engage in
          meaningful conversations, challenge dominant narratives, and explore
          alternative perspectives.

        <h2>Mission:</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to promote awareness, understanding, and active
          engagement with issues surrounding decolonization. We strive to create
          a safe and inclusive space that empowers members of the Brown
          University community to confront the historical injustices and ongoing
          manifestations of colonialism. By acknowledging and dismantling these
          structures, we aim to forge a path towards a more just, equitable, and
          inclusive campus and world.

            community on the histories and enduring impacts of colonialism.
            Through workshops, seminars, and discussions, we encourage critical
            thinking and provide a platform for marginalized voices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advocacy:</strong> We actively advocate for policies and
            practices that challenge colonial frameworks within the university.
            By collaborating with student organizations and faculty, we work to
            implement inclusive practices and curricula that reflect diverse
            perspectives.

          <li>
            <strong>Community Building:</strong> Carte Blanche is a welcoming
            community for students passionate about decolonization. We encourage
            dialogue across cultural boundaries, fostering mutual respect, and
            promoting a culture of unity and solidarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Events and Activities:</strong> To foster engagement, we
            organize events, film screenings, and speaker series that highlight
            decolonial movements, current issues, and the work of decolonial
            thinkers and activists.

          <li>
            <strong>Collaborations:</strong> We believe that collective action
            is vital to effecting change. Carte Blanche collaborates with other

        <h2>Values:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Intersectionality:</strong> We recognize that decolonization
            is intertwined with various social justice struggles. Therefore, we
            actively engage with issues of race, class, gender, and other forms
            of oppression to develop a holistic understanding of decolonization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empowerment:</strong> Carte Blanche empowers individuals to
            reclaim their narratives and histories, offering a supportive
            platform to share experiences and knowledge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Respectful Dialogue:</strong> We promote an atmosphere of
            respectful dialogue, acknowledging diverse viewpoints while
            critiquing systems of power and oppression.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action-Oriented:</strong> While dialogue is essential, we
            also emphasize the importance of action. Carte Blanche seeks
            tangible change through advocacy and collaboration.
          </li>
